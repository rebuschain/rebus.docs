## Address Converter

The address converter is a tool to translate a cosmos-based address to an evm-based address and vice versa.
The interface is pretty simple:

When you first land on the page you will see an input for either an EVM or Cosmos address.

If you enter a EVM address it will return the associated Cosmos address.
