# Rebus Assets Management

The assets page in the Rebus App allows you to view all of your assets and to convert assets from the Cosmos to ERC-20 address. If you are connected with Metamask it will show both your ERC-20 and Cosmos based assets. If you are connected with Keplr or similar it will only show your Cosmos based assets.
