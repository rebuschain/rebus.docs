## Welcome to Rebus, where TradFi and DeFi come hand in hand, an intersection bringing the two worlds together

Investment in crypto assets is bound to grow, and naturally more people are turning to their traditional financial institutions expecting crypto services to be available. That’s where we come in, we’ll assist in building the best crypto products possible for conventional financial establishments.

> _Decentralized finance (commonly referred to as DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks to offer traditional financial instruments, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains._(Wikipedia)

For the team this is only partially true, their future vision of the space is an intersection between traditional finance (TraFi) and the DeFi world.

## Why Rebus?

In latin Rebus means “affairs” also in many languages it’s a puzzle in which words are represented by combinations of pictures and individual letters.
