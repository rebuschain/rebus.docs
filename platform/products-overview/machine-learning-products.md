# Machine Learning Products

This section describes products based on the Rebus Machine-Learning (ML) Engine:  

* ML Product 1 - AMC Minimum Variance
* ML Product 2 - AMC Minimum Variance ESG
* ML Product 3 - AMC Liquidity Pool Weights Optimization

## Summary

The purpose of Machine Learning-based products is to take advantage of modern statistical and data analysis techniques to build products with a **higher** [**Sharpe Ratio**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp). In other words, these products are created with ML to maximize the investor's reliability and effectiveness for rewards.

To participate, an investor invests in a [Vault](rebus-vault.md) in which the **Rebus ML Asset Allocation Engine** rebalances the exposures on the underlying DeFi asset.

## ML Product 1 - AMC Minimum Variance

The product invests in a basket of crypto assets that can change during the life of the product. The weight of investment on the singular crypto asset is managed daily and based on the **Rebus ML Asset Allocation Engine**.  

‍**Investment Currency**: FIAT

‍**Who invests in this product?** Those concerned about single asset/chain volatility and interested in stable growth over a longer period of time.

‍**Rewards**: The share value is linked to the weighted average performance of the underlying crypto investments, the ‘basket.’ The share may be divested daily at the market price.

‍**Duration**: Perpetual - redemption is allowed at any time at the current market price.

‍**Currency Risk (for investors, FIAT based)**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

**Market Risk:** **<span style="color:red">High</span>**

‍**Overall Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

‍**Risks**: Decline of the underlying \[crypto\] asset prices. The algorithm optimizes the risk, so it’s lower than the risk of the investment in a single cryptocurrency.

‍**Opportunities**: increase of the underlying crypto prices.

## ML Product 2 - AMC Minimum Variance ESG

This product is similar to ML Product 1, but it adds, in the optimization process, some constraints that belong to the ESG matter.  
ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance.  
> Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward of nature (e.g. electricity consumption in the case of Block Chain investment). Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights \[source [_Investopedia_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria.asp)\].  
‍

In this product, Rebus uses these criteria in the valuation of the investment in every single crypto in the basket and uses the ESG score as a constraint for the **Rebus ML Asset Allocation Engine**.  

**Investment Currency**: FIAT

**Who invests in this product?** Those who consider the ESG score when making long-term, more stable investments.

‍**Rewards**: The share value is linked to the weighted average performance of the underlying crypto investments. The share may be divested daily at the market price.

‍**Duration**: Perpetual - redemption is allowed at any time at the current market price.

‍**Currency Risk (for investors FIAT based)**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

‍**Market Risk**: **<span style="color:red">High</span>**

‍**Overall Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

‍**Risks**: A major decline of the underlying crypto prices. 

‍**Opportunities**: increase of the underlying crypto prices.

## ML Product 3 - AMC Liquidity Pool Weights Optimization

The Rebus ML AMM Engine aims to mitigate the impact of excessive price changes for Liquidity Providers and thus improve investment efficiency.  
This is done by using advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques when analyzing the behavior of traders to identify valuable adjustments to the coin \[asset\] weights in a dynamic and optimized way.

**Investment Currency**: FIAT  

‍**Who invests in this product?** Those looking for a comparatively low-risk DeFi investment. The product is Market NEUTRAL, even if affected by the volatility and trend of the swap prices.Similar to the Liquidity Products 1 and 2 but with an Actively Managed weights adjustment to minimize the effect of the impermanent loss.

**Reward:** Rewards scale with the number of transactions between multi pairs (Swap) that utilize the liquidity in the Pool.

‍**Duration**: Perpetual - redemption is allowed at any time at the market price.

‍**Currency Risk (for investors FIAT based)**: **<span style="color:limegreen">Low</span>**

‍**Market Risk**: **<span style="color:limegreen">Low</span>**

‍**Overall Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

‍**Risks**: A rapid price drop of one or more pairs.

‍**Opportunities**: Increase in size and frequency of the swaps
