# Staking Products

This section describes all products involving the staking of $REBUS and other Cosmos-based coins. All Staking products invest in staking in different blockchains.  
  
For the users, staking acts similarly to a high-yield savings account, except that the blockchain network operationally benefits from these staking pools.  
  
Staking is holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network.
