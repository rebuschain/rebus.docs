# Liquidity Products

This section describes all products involving the staking of $REBUS and other Cosmos-based coins. All Staking products invest in staking in different blockchains.  
  
For the users, staking acts similarly to a high-yield savings account, except that the blockchain network operationally benefits from these staking pools.Staking is holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network.
  
In other words, liquidity products are designed for efficiency, to minimize the time between an order and a purchase event by having multiple sellers ready to satisfy those requests. In DeFi, Liquidity pools are used to invest in the liquidity side of third-party Swap Protocols, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/).  

## Summary

Liquidity Products allow investors to have access to an investment with  very low probability of losses in FIAT currency.Liquidity Products are built as [Vaults](rebus-vault.md) which invest in a third-party DeFi asset.

## Liquidity Product 1 - Single Pair

A single-pair [vault](ebus-vault.md) allows an investor to invest in a third party Liquidity Deposit (Pool). The investor earns money for each transaction (Swap) within the Pool. Earnings are proportional to the frequency and size of the transactions.

**Investment Currency**: FIAT

**Who invests in such a product?**: Those looking for a moderate-to-low risk DeFi investment opportunity. The product is Market NEUTRAL even if affected by the volatility and trend of the swap prices.

**Reward**: Rewards are based on the number of transactions between a single pair (Swap) using the liquidity in the Pool.

**Duration**: Perpetual - redemption is allowed at any time at the market price.  
  
‍**Currency Risk (for investors, FIAT based)**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

**Market Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

**Overall Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

**Risks**: Pair price drops very quickly

**Opportunities**: Increase in size and frequency of the swaps

## Liquidity Product 2 - Multi-Pair Pools

The **Liquidity Product 2 - Multi pairs** is based on the same logic of the Product on the Single Pair to which it adds the possibility of investing in a third party Pool with different types of tokens (> 2) and therefore working on more pairs. These can have balanced or unbalanced weights.  
  
**Investment Currency**: FIAT

**Who invests in such a product?** Those looking for DeFi opportunities with a higher reward, yet still moderate-to-low risk as compared to single-pair products. The product is Market NEUTRAL even if affected by the volatility and trend of the swap prices.Similar to Swap Product 1 but with more diversification.

**Reward**: Rewards are based on the number of transactions between multi pairs (Swap) utilizing the liquidity in the Pool.
  
**Duration**: Perpetual - redemption is allowed at any time at the market price.

**Currency Risk (for investors, FIAT based)**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

**Market Risk**: **<span style="color:limegreen">Low</span>**
  
**Overall Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**

**Risks**: Rapid price drop of one or more pairs.  
  
‍**Opportunities**: Scales with size and frequency of swaps.

## Liquidity Product 3 - Multi-Pair Pools with Impermanent Loss Control

The **Liquidity Product with impermanent loss control** is based on the same logic as the Product on Multi Pairs, but adds the protection from the potential loss due to the market trends using a Put Option.  
  
**Investment Currency**: FIAT

**Who invests in such a product?** Those looking for moderate-to-low risk DeFi opportunity. The product is Market NEUTRAL even if affected by the volatility and trend of the swap prices. The impermanent loss is hedged using a PUT Option.  
  
Similar to the Swap Product 2 but with a major control of the impermanent loss.

**Reward:** Rewards are based on the number of transactions between multi pairs (Swap) using the liquidity in the Pool as well as the price of the pairs themselves.
  
**Duration**: Perpetual - redemption is allowed at any time at the market price.
  
**Currency Risk (for investors FIAT based)**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**
  
**Market Risk**: **<span style="color:limegreen">Low</span>**
  
**Overall Risk**: **<span style="color:orange">Medium</span>**
