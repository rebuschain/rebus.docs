# Token Economics

REBUS is the native coin of the Rebus chain and is used to pay for all the transactions / services / and fee. It is also the coin that will be distributed publicly through the public coin distribution.  
‍  
The Rebus chain is built using the Cosmos SDK and the Ethermint-Evmos project. REBUS will be listed on the major exchanges as well as on the project’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX).  
  
The total max supply will be fixed.  
  
At the genesis part of coins will be allocated to the treasury project, the community, founders, early investors, financial partners, the liquidity programs and to the public coin distribution and to the airdrop. The other part of the tokens (58.5%) will be generated as block/POS reward during the 15 years after the genesis.\

**Max supply: 1 000 000 000 (One Billion)**
