Try getting in touch with the validators you like to stake to."]},{"l":"The Validator setup","p":["When you delegate to a validator nobody wants that validator to be compromised in some way in order to prevent any form of slashing. A validator can take many precautions to mitigate this. For example: they can make a difference by upholding good hardware standards for their validator, implementing a sentry, setting up good monitoring and alerting infrastructure and making sure they have appropriate security configuration."]},{"l":"Project and Community involvement","p":["Anyone can become a validator if technically capable. A difference apart from the technical aspects can be made by their involvement in the project and the community. Some are actively trying to help the community in many different ways.

Ultimatelly, this help drive adoption of the Rebus network.","Validators that are involved with the project means that they are up-to-date on the progress of the project, what is happening and how they can use that knowledge to help educate the community and the rest of the world.","Active validators are also more likely to be well informed of network upgrades. If validators were to miss software upgrades, they would be unable to reach consensus with the rest of the network.

Validators have ongoing costs for running their validator service and it is fair that they are compensated for their time, resources and knowledge that they commit to running their validators. In addition, some validator operators commit a significant amount of their time and resources to assisting the community through the various social platforms.","Each validator has the freedom to set their own commission rates. Validators have the power to alter their commission rates as they desire within the range each validator sets when they create their validator.","When considering the amount of commission you are willing to pay, you may consider that some validators will provide the bare minimum infrastructure to run a validator while others will run enterprise grade hardware and security which comes with higher operating costs.

However, this may not always be the case."]},{"l":"Slashing history and validator uptime","p":["Each validator must strive to provide the highest uptime possible.

So every six months they check the value of Libor 6-month and define the interest to be paid. For example the index at that date can have a value of 2% so the final interest will be 2% + 1%.","Goldman Sachs floating rate bond: Reference rate is 3M USD Libor + 1.75% per annum Morgan Stanley floating rate bond. Reference/Base Rate is Libor + 1.22%","Another example would be a variable interest rate offered on a home loan. The interest paid is equal to the prime, or reference rate, plus a fixed amount, called the spread. An adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) may have a prime rate of 5% + 1%. So the borrower’s payment fluctuates up or down with the prime rate changes, but the bank can always count on the spread rate of 1%.","Ribor follows this concept but against specific DeFi cryptocurrencies to arrive at reference rates for each specific coin:","$REBUS → Ribor Reb","$ATOM → Ribor Atom","$OSMO → Ribor Osmo","$EVMOS → Ribor Evmos"]}],[{"l":"Staking Products","p":["This section describes all products involving the staking of $REBUS and other Cosmos-based coins.
