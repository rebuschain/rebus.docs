The following discussion aims to provide you with some points for consideration when selecting a validator for staking your REBUS. It is important that you do a little research before delegating your REBUS to a validator.","Some points to consider when selecting a validator:","Decentralization of the network","Reputation of the validator","Reachability of the validator","The validator setup","Project and Community involvement","Value added by the validator","Commission taken by the validator","Slashing history and validator uptime"]},{"l":"Decentralization of the network","p":["There are a limited number of validators in the active set for the network. Each validator will vote on consensus for each proposed block. The more tokens a validator has staked to them increases the power of the validators vote. It is therefore important that no one validator gains too much voting power over the network, to avoid centralization. To help with decentralization of voting power, you may consider delegating to validators lower on the list of total delegation."]},{"l":"Reputation of the validator","p":["Each validator is responsible to provide as much information as possible to potential delegators.","You may want to investigate validators you are planning on delegating to. Most validators will provide some extra information such as a bio and website that will be available by clicking on the validator's name in the https://mintscan.io/rebus blockchain explorer interface.","Some validators run Telegram, Discord, or Twitter channels where you can directly contact the operators and receive updates so that you are informed about the validators operations and maintenance activities.","Many validator operators have representation in the official Rebus Discord and Telegrams channels.","You may want to ask about particular validators in the Rebus Discord channels and/or Telegram chat."]},{"l":"Reachability of the validator","p":["Apart from some validators running a telegram, discord etc. consider how reachable a validator is. For instance, when you want to know certain specifics mentioned in this chapter or an active governance proposal, his or her validator setup (hardware used or security measures taken etc.). Try getting in touch with the validators you like to stake to."]},{"l":"The Validator setup","p":["When you delegate to a validator nobody wants that validator to be compromised in some way in order to prevent any form of slashing. A validator can take many precautions to mitigate this. For example: they can make a difference by upholding good hardware standards for their validator, implementing a sentry, setting up good monitoring and alerting infrastructure and making sure they have appropriate security configuration."]},{"l":"Project and Community involvement","p":["Anyone can become a validator if technically capable. A difference apart from the technical aspects can be made by their involvement in the project and the community. Some are actively trying to help the community in many different ways. Helping the community will help provide an excellent end user experience to Rebus network users and will in turn help the Rebus network grow. Ultimatelly, this help drive adoption of the Rebus network.","Validators that are involved with the project means that they are up-to-date on the progress of the project, what is happening and how they can use that knowledge to help educate the community and the rest of the world.","Active validators are also more likely to be well informed of network upgrades. If validators were to miss software upgrades, they would be unable to reach consensus with the rest of the network. It is most likely that the validator would end up being jailed and thus slashed for downtime."]},{"l":"Value added by the validator","p":["Some validators are able to add value for delegators in various ways. This information should be available on the validators websites."]},{"l":"Commission taken by the validator","p":["Validator commission is a percentage of the REBUS rewards earned that is provided to the validator in return for their service. Validators have ongoing costs for running their validator service and it is fair that they are compensated for their time, resources and knowledge that they commit to running their validators. In addition, some validator operators commit a significant amount of their time and resources to assisting the community through the various social platforms.","Each validator has the freedom to set their own commission rates. Validators have the power to alter their commission rates as they desire within the range each validator sets when they create their validator.","When considering the amount of commission you are willing to pay, you may consider that some validators will provide the bare minimum infrastructure to run a validator while others will run enterprise grade hardware and security which comes with higher operating costs. Sometimes a higher commission rate may represent the higher costs for some operators to provide a higher level of service. However, this may not always be the case."]},{"l":"Slashing history and validator uptime","p":["Each validator must strive to provide the highest uptime possible. From time to time, a validator may be jailed for too much downtime or double signing a block. If a validator is jailed, they and their delegators are penalized by losing a portion of their staked tokens (known as \"slashing\").","You will be able to see a validators jail history by browsing their transaction history in the block explorer. Look out for \"unjail\" transactions.","Under certain circumstances, a validator may be permanently jailed (aka \"tombstoned\".

There are various approaches, as detailed here. Some validators advocate co-locating all three nodes in virtual partitions on a single box, using Docker or other virtualisation tools. However, if in doubt, just run each node on a different server.","Bear in mind that Sentries can have pruning turned on, as outlined here. It is desirable, but not essential, to have pruning disabled on the validator node itself."]},{"l":"Managing storage","p":["If you are using a cloud services provider, you may want to mount $HOME on an externally mountable storage volume, as you may need to shuffle the data onto a larger storage device later. You can specify the home directory in most commands, or just use symlinks.","Disk space is likely to fill up, so having a plan for managing storage is key.","If you are running sentry nodes:","1TB storage for the full node will give you a lot of runway","200GB each for the sentries with pruning should be sufficient","Managing backups is outside the scope of this documentation, but several validators keep public snapshots and backups."]},{"l":"Ballpark costs","p":["To give you an idea of cost, on AWS EBS (other cloud providers are available, or you can run your own hardware), with two backups a day, this runs to roughly:","$150 for 1TB","$35 for 200GB","Total cost: $220","What approach you take for this will depend on whether you are running on physical hardware co-located with you, running in a data centre, or running on virtualised hardware."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["General instructions on how to join the Rebus testnets"]},{"l":"Joining Testnets"},{"l":"Current testnets","p":["Below is the list of Rebus testnets and their current status.
